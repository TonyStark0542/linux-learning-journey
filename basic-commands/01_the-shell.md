# The Shell
The shell is basically a program that takes your commands from the keyboard and sends them to the OS to perform.

- In every shell we see this in common:
username@hostname:current_directory$

- Username:- This is the name of the user who is currently logged in. It identifies which account is being used to run.
- Hostname:- This is the name of the computer or server you're working on. It helps to identify which machine you're using, which is particularlly useful if you're connected to a remote server.
Example:- If you see something like this - alex@server1:/var/www
It means that,
- The logged in user is alex
- They're working on server1 machine
- The current working directory is /var/www
